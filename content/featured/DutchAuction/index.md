Dutch Auction is a blockchain-powered system running on the Ethereum network, designed to streamline Dutch auctions for the sale of physical and digital assets. Leveraging Ethereum's renowned smart contract capabilities and decentralization, the project utilizes Solidity as its contract language to establish auction rules and facilitate asset transfers securely.

With the development environment powered by Hardhat, the platform ensures efficient smart contract development and testing. The user-friendly frontend, built on React, enhances interactivity, while MetaMask integration ensures secure participation.
