Flex Appeal is a one-stop, all-inclusive solution for fitness tracking. This web application allows users to keep a record of their daily health indulgences ranging from food, water, exercise, sleep, active activities etc. And observe progress over time.

This application will be developed with a responsive UI styled using SASS which uses ReactJS that is supported by a scalable NodeJS backend that uses the ExpressJS middleware to route its requests to appropriate business logic functions.
