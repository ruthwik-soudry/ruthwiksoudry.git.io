Imagine communicating without words. This is the essence of American Sign Language (ASL), a key communication medium for the Deaf community in the USA. While ASL is a rich, visual language, technology offers the opportunity to transform this visual medium into audible speech.

Our project uses a Deep Learning Model to translate ASL signs from images. To achieve optimal performance, we've embraced DataParallelism and DistributedDataParallelism techniques.
